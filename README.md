<h1> Dataset Description </h1>



<h1> Questions (2) </h1>

<ol>1. Which counties in California have the lowest food affordability ratios, and how does that relate to their median income levels?</ol>
<ol>2. Do racial and ethnic disparities in food affordability vary between the Bay Area and San Joaquin Valley in California during the 2006-2010 period?</ol>

<h1> Analysis and Results </h1>
<h2>Question 1 Visualization</h2>
<img width="650" src ="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3275bb15-9a46-4462-8ec5-ce2d6240f8ff">
<li>Counties with lower median incomes tend to have higher affordability ratios.</li>
<li>This indicates that in many counties, food consumes a larger portion of income. </li>
<li>Los Angeles County has a high food affordability ratio due to factors such as high population density and a homelessness problem that weighs down median income among other socioeconomic factors that further contribute to this problem</li>

<h2>Question 2 Visualization</h2>
<img width="650" src ="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fc14b39-67bb-47ca-85a3-c8deb4e25900">
<li>San Joaquin Valley shows greater disparities across ethnic groups.</li>
<li>African American and Latino populations face higher affordability burdens, which makes it more expensive.</li>
<li>Regional economic and housing differences likely contribute.</li>
<li>Bay Region has a higher cost of living compared to San Joaquin Valley</li>
<li>Since San Joaquin is primarily an agricultural area, the primary workforce is made up of farmers, who have lower incomes than those in the Bay Area, which leads to a higher affordability ratio 
</li>
